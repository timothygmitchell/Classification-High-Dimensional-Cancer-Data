# Classification-High-Dimensional-Cancer-Data

This project showcases a variety of techniques in high-dimensional data analysis, including classification (quadratic discriminant analysis, random forest), dimension reduction (principal component analysis), and multivariate tests of mean vectors.

A key component of this analysis is evaluating assumptions such as multivariate normality, equality of variances, and absence of multicollinearity.

For QDA, I use misclassification rate as well as jackknifing to evaluate model error.

For random forests, I evaluate out-of-bag error and optimize parameters via systematic parameter search.
